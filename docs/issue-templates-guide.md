# Issue Templates Guide for Teachers

## Overview

We've created **5 easy-to-use issue templates** to help you request changes to the Mergington High School Activity Management System without needing to write code or understand technical details.

## What Are Issue Templates?

Issue templates are pre-formatted forms that guide you through providing all the necessary information for common tasks. They ensure that developers (or GitHub Copilot) have everything needed to complete your request quickly and accurately.

## Tips for Success

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Be specific** - Provide exact names, times, and details
- **Explain why** - Help us understand the need behind your request
- **Include examples** - Real examples make it easier to understand
- **Check existing issues** - Make sure you're not duplicating a request

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- **Skip required fields** - We need all the information to help you
- **Be vague** - "Make it better" doesn't give us enough to work with
- **Submit duplicates** - Check if someone already requested the same thing
- **Include sensitive information** - Don't put passwords or private data in issues

## What Each Template Includes

Every template has been designed with four key components:

### 1. **Clear Problem Description**
Structured form fields that guide you to explain exactly what you need.

### 2. **Acceptance Criteria**
Built-in criteria that defines what success looks like, so you know what to expect.

### 3. **Implementation Hints**
Technical guidance for developers (or Copilot) on where to make changes, which files to modify, and what to consider.

### 4. **Context and Limitations**
Important information about how the system works and any constraints to be aware of.
